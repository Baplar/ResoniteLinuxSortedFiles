# LinuxSortedFiles

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that improves the behavior of the Files dashboard tab on Linux, by sorting files by name and fixing a handful of other Linux-specific issues.

This is a RML-compatible rewrite of [this BepisLoader mod by NepuShiro](https://github.com/NepuShiro/ResoniteLinuxSortedFiles).

## Installation

This mod should only be used on Linux. This mod is unnecessary (and unsupported) on Windows.

- Locate your Resonite install folder. It should be at `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Resonite` for a default install.
- In your Resonite install folder, enter the `rml_mods` subfolder. It should already exist if you installed RML properly.
- Download [LinuxSortedFiles.dll](https://github.com/Baplar/ResoniteLinuxSortedFiles/releases/latest/download/LinuxSortedFiles.dll) and place it in the `rml_mods` folder.
